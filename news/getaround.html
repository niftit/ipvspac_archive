(“InterPrivate”) (NYSE: IPVA), a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company, entered into a definitive business combination agreement that will result in Getaround becoming a public company upon completion of the transaction. Upon closing, the combined company is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol “GETR.” The combined company will be led by Getaround Founder and CEO, Sam Zaid.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Getaround’s mission is to fundamentally change the paradigm of car ownership. Getaround’s technology platform addresses the severe underutilization of vehicles throughout the world – 95% of a vehicle’s life is idle, resting in a parking space, rather than producing income for its owner and mobility solutions for the consumer. Through its proprietary technology, Getaround allows for an entirely digital and contactless carsharing experience unlike its competitors. Getaround Connect® enables consumers to reserve instantly and retrieve within minutes a nearby vehicle, without the need to fill out paperwork, wait in line or physically exchange keys. Additionally, the digital ease of Getaround Connect empowers hosts to build profitable and sustainable businesses by allowing them to easily scale and manage large fleets of vehicles across wide market regions.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Management Commentary</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Getaround is about empowering people everywhere to share cars and making the sharing experience increasingly simpler and more reliable through the use of digital and connected technology. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure Getaround is as convenient as personal car ownership,” said Zaid. “Consumers seeking to use a car or truck no longer need to stand in lines, fill out paperwork, or endure all of the hassles associated with owning and maintaining a vehicle. We are accelerating a much-needed transition from a legacy, analog car rental experience to a fully digital and ‘keyless’ carsharing experience. The transaction with InterPrivate is pivotal to our long-term growth strategy. Proceeds will be used for continued product innovation, to densify the supply of digitally connected cars in our existing markets, and to increase both the mix and proximity of our cars and trucks for consumers. We will also look to bring our proven model to new markets, both domestic and abroad. Getaround is thrilled to partner with a reputable and trusted partner such as InterPrivate to usher in this exciting new chapter in our company’s rich history as a publicly traded company.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Getaround is one of the two largest players in the global car-sharing market that it helped pioneer,” said Ahmed Fattouh, Chairman &amp; CEO of InterPrivate. "We are proud to partner with such an established leadership team — founder-led and bolstered by top executives with experience across leading Silicon Valley companies. As a relentless innovator, the Company has designed and deployed its proprietary Getaround Connect technology to build formidable network effects in cities across the globe, improving utilization of automotive assets and transforming the way its customers access transportation. Getaround has demonstrated years of strong execution — as evidenced by their robust growth, established scale, and demonstrated adjusted EBITDA profitability in key cities. Our merger is expected to accelerate the expansion of the Company's uniquely enduring asset-light marketplace within one of the largest consumer categories, providing more efficient mobility for global consumers along the way.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jason Mudrick, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Mudrick Capital Management, LP, a global investment firm, added, "We are excited to partner with Getaround on its business combination with InterPrivate to go public. The Company's loyal consumer following, established scale, attractive unit economics and sustainable technology advantages fit the profile we seek in our growth investment strategy – business models that have hit their inflection point and are ready for their public market debut. Our significant capital commitment of up to $175 million is expected to help Sam Zaid and his team execute on their global expansion plan. We are pleased to back InterPrivate in this important transaction and look forward to continuing our collaboration around their serial SPAC strategy."</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Key Investment Highlights</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Top 2 player globally in peer to peer carsharing </strong>– Operates in more than 950 cities in 8 countries with 1.6 million guests using 66k cars shared by hosts</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Large total addressable market enabled by digital model </strong>– Serviceable addressable market estimated at $155 billion</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Marketplace model is asset-light and powered by network effects </strong>–<strong> </strong>Strong long-term defensibility of carsharing model</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Differentiated tech of connected cars enables superior UX </strong>–<strong> </strong>Creates a seamless host and guest value proposition</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Demonstrated path to adjusted EBITDA profitability across top 20 cities, </strong>with strong profit margin per transaction and top 20 cities in aggregate have demonstrated adjusted EBITDA profitability during 2021</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Fully funded(1) business plan and highly attractive financial profile</strong></p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Getaround’s leading market position is reinforced by foundational partnerships with global automotive OEMs such as Toyota and integrations with car hailing apps such as Uber. There are 1.2 billion legacy cars and trucks that Getaround is able to digitize with its patented IoT technology. By 2025, Counterpoint Research expects there to be more than 270 million connected cars and trucks. There is a clear secular shift in the way many people view vehicle ownership; an attitude that is informed by the ethical imperatives of waste mitigation, efficiency, environmental protection and equity. By participating in the carsharing economy, we can reduce congestion, eliminate up to 100 billion pounds of CO2 for every million cars and trucks that join the platform, and provide a cost-effective transportation solution to communities around the globe.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Transaction Overview</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The transaction represents a combined company pro forma equity value of approximately $1.2 billion assuming no redemptions from InterPrivate’s $259 million Trust. The business combination is expected to result in at least $225 million and up to $434 million in gross proceeds to the Company, including a convertible note commitment of up to $175 million provided by affiliates of Mudrick Capital Management, LP. The Company believes the net transaction proceeds will provide adequate funding to achieve adjusted EBITDA breakeven under its current business plan.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Boards of Directors of Getaround and InterPrivate have unanimously approved the transaction. The transaction will require the approval of the stockholders of both Getaround and InterPrivate, and is subject to other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additional information about the proposed transaction, including a copy of the merger agreement and investor presentation, will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by InterPrivate with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and will be available on the InterPrivate website at <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipvspac.com%2Fipva&amp;esheet=52715542&amp;newsitemid=20220511005445&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.ipvspac.com%2Fipva&amp;index=3&amp;md5=e8fcc6aa6ac7d6313da57fb29ae3c677" target="_blank">www.ipvspac.com/ipva</a>, Getaround Investor Relations page at www.getaround.com/investors and at <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&amp;esheet=52715542&amp;newsitemid=20220511005445&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.sec.gov&amp;index=4&amp;md5=67d6457f53a08dfb5a66fdd1d3d89623" target="_blank">www.sec.gov</a>.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Investor Conference Call Information</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Getaround and InterPrivate will host a joint investor conference call to discuss the proposed transaction, May 12, 2022 at 8:00 am ET.
