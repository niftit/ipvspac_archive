In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” and “will,” and similar expressions. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to statements regarding the benefits of the Business Combination and becoming a public company and Getaround’s market opportunity and prospects for success in the public markets. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this document, including, but not limited to: (i) the effect of the Business Combination on Getaround’s business relationships, performance, and business generally; (ii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Getaround or against InterPrivate II following the completion of the Business Combination; (iii) the ability to meet New York Stock Exchange listing standards; (iv) changes in the competitive and highly regulated industries in which Getaround operates, variations in performance across competitors and changes in laws and regulations affecting Getaround’s business; (v) the ability to implement business plans, forecasts, and other expectations , gauge and adapt to industry trends and changing host, guest and consumer preferences, and identify and realize additional opportunities; (vi) the failure to realize anticipated benefits of the transaction or to realize estimated pro forma results and underlying assumptions, (vii) the risk of adverse or changing economic conditions, including the resulting effects on consumer spending, and the possibility of rapid change in the highly competitive industry in which Getaround operates; (xii) the risk that Getaround and its current and future partners are unable to successfully develop and scale Getaround’s products and offerings, or experience significant delays in doing so; (xiii) the acceptance or adoption of carsharing as an alternative to car ownership in the geographies in which Getaround operates its business; and (xiv) risks associated with increased competition among providers of carsharing or other modes of transportation. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” section of the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed by InterPrivate II with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 16, 2022, and other documents filed by InterPrivate II from time to time with the SEC. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and Getaround and InterPrivate II assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Neither Getaround nor InterPrivate II gives any assurance that either Getaround or InterPrivate II will achieve its expectations.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>(1) Approximately $228 million of gross proceeds includes amounts retained in InterPrivate II’s trust account, the conversion of approximately $37.5 million of bridge notes and the issuance of $175 million of convertible notes.
