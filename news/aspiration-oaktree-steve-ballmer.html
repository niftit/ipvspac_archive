  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>LOS ANGELES,&nbsp;December 15, 2021</strong> — Aspiration (“Aspiration” or the “Company”), a global leader in Sustainability as a Service solutions for consumers and companies, and InterPrivate III Financial Partners Inc. (NYSE: IPVF) (“InterPrivate III”), a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company, announced today that the Company has secured $315 million of incremental equity financings from funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”), a leading global alternative investment management firm, and investment affiliates of businessman and investor Steve Ballmer (“Ballmer”). The new financing includes $250 million in proceeds from the issuance of non-convertible perpetual preferred stock, paying an 8% dividend and redeemable by investors after 9 years, $50 million of investment in the form of mandatorily convertible pre-merger securities of Aspiration purchased at a SPAC equivalent price of $11 and $15 million of investment in the form of an IPVF common stock PIPE priced at $11 per share closing concurrently with the business combination.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“As fighting climate change continues to become front and center for more people and businesses, Aspiration’s technology, brand and community of members make it one of the most significant new companies in the public markets,” said Steve Ballmer.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Aspiration is a category creator at the intersection of the growing fintech and sustainability industries,” said Brian Laibow, Managing Director and Co-Head of North America for Oaktree's Global Opportunities strategy. “We're delighted to partner with the Aspiration team as they continue to scale their growth and impact.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Raising significant equity now at a premium to the initial deSPAC valuation, coupled with non-dilutive long-term preferred financing, demonstrates a recognition of Aspiration’s accelerated growth this year,” said Aspiration CEO Andrei Cherny. “The switch to sustainability will likely be the largest, fastest shift in behavior in human history and we are proud to welcome the support of such respected investors as we move toward a historic listing to bring sustainability services and ESG-driven financial solutions to the public market.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ahmed Fattouh, Chairman and CEO of InterPrivate III, added, “The Oaktree and Ballmer financings, secured on attractive terms, confirm our thesis and significantly increase the minimum proceeds available for Aspiration to fully execute against all of its growth initiatives. Our confidence has only grown as Aspiration has generated impressive operating results, forged promising new strategic partnerships, and added world-class investors.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This additional capital broadens and deepens the roster of blue-chip institutions and leading investors supporting the closing of Aspiration’s business combination, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to approval by InterPrivate III’s shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other closing conditions identified in the business combination agreement entered into by Aspiration and InterPrivate III. Aspiration now expects cumulative net proceeds exceeding $700 million inclusive of these financings, together with the original $200 million common stock PIPE entered into in August of 2021 and assuming no redemptions from InterPrivate’s approximately $260 million trust account.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Union Square Advisors LLC served as the exclusive financial advisors to Aspiration leading the equity financing transaction with Oaktree.
