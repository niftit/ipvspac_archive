(“Aspiration” or the “Company”), a global leader in Sustainability as a Service solutions for consumers and companies, and InterPrivate III Financial Partners Inc. (NYSE: IPVF) (“InterPrivate III”), a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company, announced today a definitive merger agreement that will result in Aspiration becoming a publicly listed company. Upon closing of the transaction, the company will be named Aspiration, Inc., and is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol “ASP.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Aspiration offers an ecosystem of sustainable banking services, credit cards, and investment products that help customers keep their deposits out of fossil fuels, automatically plant trees with every card purchase, and track business and personal Planet &amp; People impact scores so they can shop with a conscience. Aspiration’s technology and tools also provide bundled solutions that help businesses meet the demand for sustainability from their customers and employees by offsetting their carbon footprints and developing co-branded products and services that mitigate climate change. The Company’s corporate partners range from software publisher Intuit to NEU Community, which is launching a community of sustainable homes outside of Austin TX in partnership with Aspiration.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over five million Americans have signed up as members, joining one of the largest communities of Conscious Consumers in the world. The company has a revenue run rate in excess of $100 million as of June 2021 and has driven over 7x growth in the past year.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Aspiration’s sustainable impact grows alongside its financial success. In the past year alone, Aspiration’s individual and business customers have funded the reforestation of over 35 million trees, planting on average more trees each day than there are in New York’s Central Park. The cumulative climate impact of the Aspiration community thus far is the equivalent of taking every car in the state of Connecticut off the road for a year.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Most Americans want to do their part to fight the climate crisis but don’t know where to start and don’t know how to make a real difference – and this is where Aspiration comes in,” said Andrei Cherny, CEO and Co-Founder of Aspiration. “Aspiration is in the business of fighting the climate crisis. We help people and businesses build sustainable impact into what they do every day by making it easy, automated, and powerful, whether it is in the ways people spend and save their money or the ways businesses engage their customers. The switch to sustainability will likely be the largest, fastest shift in behavior in human history, and Aspiration has a central role to play in powering that transformation for individuals and businesses alike.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Joe Sanberg, Co-Founder and Board Member, commented: “We’re in a “zero to one” moment as companies of all sizes are quickly realizing that addressing the demand for sustainability from their customers and workforce is essential to their financial success. Aspiration is fast becoming a critical part of the infrastructure of a Good Economy built on sustainability and conscience.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Through its merger with InterPrivate, Aspiration will become the first ESG-driven fintech, a unique platform enabling individuals and enterprises to integrate and automate impact into their every-day financial and commercial transactions. The millions of passionate Aspiration members are an asset unto themselves, and have helped create a brand synonymous with sustainability that we expect to see extend in many exciting directions,” said Ahmed Fattouh, Chairman and CEO of InterPrivate III. “With strong secular tailwinds, Aspiration is growing rapidly, and we look forward to helping Andrei, Joe and the team execute on their strategic plans,” added Nicholaos Krenteras, President of InterPrivate III.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mr. Cherny will remain the CEO of the combined company while Mr. Sanberg will continue to serve on the Board.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Transaction Overview</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The transaction implies a pro forma equity valuation for Aspiration of $2.3 billion, or 7.7x implied enterprise value to projected 2022 revenue of $254 million and 3.8x projected revenue of $508 million for 2023. Consideration to Aspiration’s shareholder will comprise at least 175 million shares of InterPrivate III common stock, as well as up to an additional 100 million shares based on the performance in the share price over a 5-year period. In addition, funds and accounts managed by Financière Agache (the Bernard Arnault family office), Doha Venture Capital (Qatar), Capricorn Investment Group, Serengeti Asset Management, Brand Capital International (the strategic investment arm of The Times Group), Western &amp; Southern Life Insurance, InterPrivate Capital, AGO Partners, and Drake are leading participants in the $200 million PIPE at a price of $10.00 per share of common stock of InterPrivate III immediately prior to the closing of the transaction.(1)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After giving effect to the transaction, the Company is expected to have over $400 million of cash to accelerate Aspiration’s growth initiatives, which include marketing and further investment in product innovation and technology.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">At the closing of the transaction, Aspiration will become a Public Benefit Corporation under Delaware law with a public purpose to “help those we serve Do Well and Do Good for People and the Planet.” Aspiration, which has been named to the “Best for the World” list of the top five percent of highest scored certified B Corporations four years in a row, will be the only publicly traded consumer financial institution that is a Public Benefit Corporation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The boards of directors for both Aspiration and InterPrivate III have unanimously approved the proposed business combination, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to, among other things, the approval by InterPrivate III’s stockholders of the merger and the concurrent PIPE transaction; satisfaction of the conditions stated in the definitive agreement and other customary closing conditions, including that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) completes its review of the proxy statement/prospectus; the receipt of certain regulatory approvals; and, approval by the New York Stock Exchange to list the securities of the combined company.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Advisors</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is acting as financial advisor, Union Square Advisors is acting as capital markets advisor, and Latham &amp; Watkins is acting as legal advisor to Aspiration.
